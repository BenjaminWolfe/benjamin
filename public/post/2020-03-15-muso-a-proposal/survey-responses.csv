"Timestamp","1. When you're coding, how often do you have R open somewhere on your computer (in any form, including RStudio desktop, RStudio server, or Microsoft R Open)? Note: If “never,” please feel free to skip the remaining questions.","2. When you're coding, how often are you listening to music? Note: If “never,” please feel free to skip the remaining questions. Though also feel free to read out of curiosity and answer when it makes sense.","3. Do you enjoy hearing music that's new to you... including while you code? Note: If “actively dislike,” please feel free to skip the remaining questions. Though also feel free to read out of curiosity and answer when it makes sense.","4. How often do you share the music you're listening to with other people?","5–8. Of the time you're coding to music, how often do you listen to… [a set playlist]","5–8. Of the time you're coding to music, how often do you listen to… [a radio-like experience]","5–8. Of the time you're coding to music, how often do you listen to… [a song on repeat]","5–8. Of the time you're coding to music, how often do you listen to… [random songs]","9. Only if you're comfortable answering: When you have R open, how often is it running on a remote machine, e.g. on RStudio Server or via SSH?","1. A real-time collaborative playlist / radio experience? You & others would listen to the same music at the same time, and any of you can add music for the group as you go.","2. Interacting with the playlist using R (connected to a server via plumber API)? For example, there might be functions to list and join active stations, add tracks, upvote / downvote songs, flag content, and save music for later.","3. Connecting your listening experience to Twitter? I.e. you might know that you're collaborating with @thomasp85 on a station inspired by Koop, or you could invite @beeonaposy to listen to Ratatat.","4. Creating and editing playlists within the same experience? For example, sometimes you might just listen to a playlist—but this feature would also help you organize tracks for easy recall later.","5. All your data being available to you, in a tidy format, to remember just what you listened to on what stations and when?","6. Sharing some of that data? You would have control over what listening history / upvoting / downvoting / flagging data is publicly visible.","7. Being able to save your active R project name and filename as secure, one-way hashes? That way you could ask “what songs did I listen to when I was working on this code?” But you couldn't ask “what projects and files did I code to this song?” (And more importantly, no one else could.)","8. As a data scientist, being able to create & deploy your own music-selecting bots to add tracks to a shared station? You could use R (tutorials + vignettes TBD), with whatever data you and other R users make available as you listen to music.","9. As a member of the #rstats community, being able to check out the results of other people's music bots?","10. A shiny web app to open this functionality to non-R-users? That way it's not cloistered within the #rstats community. It would still be R-native, though, and (to borrow a phrase from @tylermorganwall) data would be a first-class citizen.","1. How would you prioritize... the ability to import your current playlists from other services and websites?","2. How would you prioritize... the ability to sync playlists / favorites back to other services or websites?","3. If you're comfortable answering, what's streaming service(s) do you usually use to listen to music (e.g. Spotify, Amazon, Apple, Google, YouTube, SoundCloud, or just owned music)?","4. Among the services you use: Some people have a strong preference for 1–2 music services—maybe they have a long history with it or they pay for a subscription—while others bounce around and listen to music wherever they find it. Where would you place yourself in that spectrum?","5. If you have a strong preference, do you mind sharing it? If you don't mind, please share below:","6. How would you want the project to handle it the situation described?","7. How would you prioritize your preferred solution? (Doesn't apply to all answers.)","8. Any other comments on music service integration?","1. Several companies offer authentication services, where you “Sign in with [company name]” (often called OAuth2). If I picked, say, 1–2 that most people are OK with, it would streamline the process quite a bit. Which of the following authentication options might you use if it was available? (Select one or more that apply.)","2. Are there any of these services you would *not* use for authentication? I wouldn't want to prioritize an option that most people are actively opposed to.","3. Please share anything else you’d like to on authentication. This is important to me, as it could be a barrier to adoption, and it could also be simple to address.","1. If in the end this appears to be a good idea—good enough to continue—would you be interested in helping out in any of these ways? If so, please reach out via Twitter (@BenjaminWolfe) or R4DS.online (DM Benjamin Wolfe), or share your contact information in the comments (Twitter or R4DS Slack preferred).","2. Anything else you'd like to say or ask after reading through the survey? If asking a question, please make sure I know who you are so I can answer you.
