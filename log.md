# Developer Log
## First Steps

* Refreshed my memory a bit with [this post][1] from [@djnavarro][2].
* Simply used the New Project dialog to create a new blogdown site,
  with theme `gcushen/hugo-academic`. Could have said to use version control.
  Didn't.
* Made a bare repository in GitHub.
* Made gitignore with `.Rproj.user`, `.Rhistory`, `.DS_Store`.
* `cd` to the directory then `git init` then `git remote add origin`
  and the repo URL.
* From here on in it's normal git stuff... add, commit, push, etc.
* Emojis are added with [gitmoji-cli][3].
* [VSCode][4] is actually a really reasonable UI for it.
