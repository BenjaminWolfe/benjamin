Data scientist [@DP_InsurTech](https://www.twitter.com/DP_InsurTech),
recreational [#rstats](https://www.twitter.com/#rstats) developer, 
lifelong learner, analytics community builder, and tidyverse fan.

I live in Austin, TX with my wife Karin and kids Brylie & Evan,
all of us Bay Area transplants. 
When I'm not at my laptop, you can find me with my white lab, Ivy,
my [Roo hammock](https://kammok.com/products/roo-double-camping-hammock),
my binoculars, and my journal.
