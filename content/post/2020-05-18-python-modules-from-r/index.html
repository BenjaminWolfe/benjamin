<p>This is a draft post! Good lord please don’t read it.</p>
<p>Note to self… maybe make the examples have 4 scripts with toy code in them,
with 3 functions,
so I can split them into 2 folders in the Python part.</p>
<p>When you’re coding in #rstats and you want to modularize your code,
there are roughly two ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>one way when for scripts,</li>
<li>and another for writing packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way you do it for scripts is usually the first way most of us learn.
Say you have a project, and it lives in a folder called <code>my_r_project</code>.
In that project, you have 3 scripts,
<code>script_1.R</code>, <code>script_2.R</code>, and <code>script_3.R</code>,
and you’re starting to notice that they tend to use the same two functions,
<code>hello()</code> and <code>world()</code>.</p>
<p>BLA BLA BLA process tell reader that you move them both into <code>fave_functions.R</code>
and then you replace them in <code>script_1.R</code>, <code>script_2.R</code>, and <code>script_3.R</code> with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>source(&quot;fave_functions.R&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>And then those functions are available in the rest of it.
(Maybe note that it’s available right there in the global environment,
shows up in the upper right of RStudio.)</p>
<p>If you’re writing a package, it feels a little different…
you have your package directory…
and then in that you have a folder called <code>R</code> where all your code lives…
and you follow Hadley’s advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While you’re free to arrange functions into files as you wish,
the two extremes are bad: don’t put all functions into one file
and don’t put each function into its own separate file.
(It’s OK if some files only contain one function,
particularly if the function is large or has a lot of documentation.).
File names should be meaningful and end in .R.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From here: <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html" class="uri">http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html</a></p>
<p>And then you follow the rest of the advice in all the microtutorials on this,
and then you get to do the really cool thing of using <code>library(fave_functions)</code>
and using them in your code.</p>
<p>Of course, they now don’t show up in the global environment in the upper right,
but you <em>can</em> just write <code>hello()</code> and it’ll work.</p>
<p>And even if you don’t use <code>library(fave_functions)</code>, you can also use <code>fave_functions::hello()</code>.</p>
<p>BLA BLA BLA</p>
<p>Cool thing is they’re just the same in Python.</p>
<p>You can put <code>fave_functions.py</code> in the same folder where you are
and then use <code>import fave_functions</code> and you’re good.</p>
<p>Difference here though is that you still have to say <code>fave_functions.hello()</code>,
which is why most people would use <code>import fave_functions as ff</code>
and then just say <code>ff.hello()</code>.</p>
<p>And then, for packages, it’s like this…
You make your package folder, called <code>fave_functions</code>
and then in it you can have any number of python files with functions in them.
And you use a file called <code>__init__.py</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from file1 import (fun1, fun2)
from file2 import (fun3)</code></pre>
<p>And then in your code you do the same thing,
<code>import fave_functions as ff</code>.</p>
<p>So how does Python know where to look for this folder?
After all, in R you just use <code>install.packages()</code> and download it.
Well R itself, you may have noticed (and if you haven’t you will at some point),
has its own install directory.
It varies by OS, but on a Mac for example it’s <code>...</code></p>
<p>And R only knows to look <em>there</em> because it’s on a variable called <code>.libPaths()</code>.
You can run that and see exactly where R looks for packages.
If the package is there, R will find it!
If it’s not, then it won’t.</p>
<p>It’s very much the same with Python.
Python just doesn’t distinguish so sharply between packages and plain old files.
So it <em>first</em> looks in the directory you’re in.
And it <em>then</em> starts scanning through the autoexec path.
It’s helpful to set that yourself by looking at {insert documentation here}.</p>
<p>So that’s all there is to know!</p>
<ul>
<li>Python isn’t that different from R in this regard.</li>
<li>Python treats plain files and packages very similarly.</li>
<li>Python also still makes you qualify your references.</li>
<li>Bonus: Modularizing code isn’t that different even in R
whether you’re just writing scripts or developing a package.</li>
</ul>
<p>FWIW maybe note that it’s kind of cool to use pd.DataFrame etc.
It makes it really clear where everything’s coming from.</p>
<p>Also remember the file in R where it says what all the imports are?</p>
