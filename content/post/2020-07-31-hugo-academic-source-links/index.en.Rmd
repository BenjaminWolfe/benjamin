## Source Links

If you've ever noticed, at the top of any Tidyverse documentation page
is a link to the source file for the functions described on the page.

This level of out-there transparency may or may not be
what you want in your blog.
But it's especially useful in a work context.

Consider the scenario:

* Aasif runs an analysis in January and writes about it in the team blog.
  Stakeholders and others throughout the company read about it there.
* Bianca, a VP, is looking at the results 3 months later
  and is curious if they still hold with the new data that's come in,
  or if we tweak such-and-such an assumption.
* But Aasif is on vacation, so Bianca asks Charlie to run the analysis.
  She shows him the post where she read about it all.
  __The source link literally could not be more obvious,__
  right at the top of the post.
  So Charlie has a much easier time re-running it.

Now we all know that's not the end of the story;
it only means he's found the file!
But finding the file _that easily_ is not at all trivial
in a multi-team environment.

So I've implemented these little links at work,
and I've done it here as well.
It's actually pretty easy to do.

## How to Add Source Links

It takes no more than 6 steps—counting liberally.
After we walk through those steps, I'll explain how they work.

1. In [`config/_default/params.toml`][params] find this line
   and ensure it's accurate:

   ```bash
   # Enable visitors to edit pages?
   #   `repo` defines the repository URL. `editable` defines which page types can be edited.
   edit_page = {repo_url = "https://github.com/BenjaminWolfe/benjamin", content_dir = "", repo_branch = "main", editable = {docs = true, page = false, post = false}}
   ```

1. Add these lines after it:

   ```bash
   # Show source links?
   #   `source_path` is everything between `repo_url` and `repo_branch` (above)
   #   in the link to an Rmd, ipynb, or md file. It varies from provider to provider.
   show_source_links = true
   source_path = "/blob/"
   ```

1. Find the file `themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/page_metadata.html`
   and copy it to [`layouts/partials/page_metadata.html`][metadata].
   (That is, copy it from `themes/hugo-academic` into the root of your site.)
   This is how you override a template in Hugo;
   that way if you update your Hugo Academic theme, you won't lose your changes.

1. At the top of the file after `$is_list` and `$page` are defined,
   add this line:

   ```go
   {{ $source_url := print $page.File.Dir $page.File.BaseFileName ($page.Params.source_extension | default ".md") }}
   ```

1. Then, after the section on article reading time, add this code block:

   ```html
     {{ if and (site.Params.show_source_links) (eq $page.Type "post") }}
     <span class="middot-divider"></span>
     <span class="source-reference">
       <a href="{{ site.Params.edit_page.repo_url }}{{ site.Params.source_path }}{{ site.Params.edit_page.repo_branch }}/content/{{ $source_url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{ $source_url }}</a>
     </span>
     {{ end }}
   ```
   
1. Finally, when you start [each post][this-post], include this in the YAML:

   ```yaml
   source_extension: '.Rmd'
   ```

## How Does It Work?

I think the [Hugo docs][hugo] are actually really intuitive and user-friendly,
on a par maybe with the [Tidyverse][tidyverse] and [jQuery][jquery] docs.
Reading through them even cursorily
gives you a pretty good sense of how things work.

### Site Parameters

Anything you put in [`config/_default/params.toml`][params] is accessible
with `site.Params.your_lowercase_toml_parameter`.

* This is where we get
  `site.Params.show_source_links` and `site.Params.source_path`,
  parameters you've just added yourself.
* Two others already existed:
  `site.Params.edit_page.repo_url` and `site.Params.edit_page.repo_branch`.

### Post Header YAML

Anything you put in the YAML headers of a file are accessible
with `.page.Params.your_lowercase_yaml_parameter`.
The accessor is slightly different here—starting with `$p` rather than `.p`—only
because `$page` is defined as equal to `.page` a few lines earlier.

This is where `$page.Params.source_extension` comes from.
Note that if you are sure you'll always write `.Rmd` files,
you can hard-code this into the template!
Then you can skip the parameter in your post headers.

Adding it to the YAML means the links will work for R Markdown,
Jupyter Notebooks, or plain old markdown files.

### Built-In Variables

`$page.File.Dir` and `$page.File.BaseFileName` are built-in page attributes,
documented straightforwardly in the [Hugo docs][hugo-page-variables].

### Variable Definition

Variables in Hugo are declared with the `:=` operator.
Later _changes_ to the variable's value can be made with `=` (no colon).

### Defaults

The `default` statement is a little trick I picked up
from [`themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/page_edit.html`][page-edit],
as I was looking to replace instances of `master` with `main`:

```html
<a href="{{site.Params.edit_page.repo_url}}/edit/{{site.Params.edit_page.repo_branch | default "master"}}/{{$content_dir}}/{{.File.Path}}">
```

Here it's reasonable to assume an `.md` file extension if one isn't specified.
This is especially the case if you happen to be using [`hugodown`][hugodown];
`hugodown` will _always_ have an `.md` file,
since it allows Hugo to generate the HTML files server-side.

### Print Statement

[`print`][hugo-print] here functions like `paste0` in R,
simply concatenating the arguments after it.

### Curly-Curly Operators

[`layouts/partials/page_metadata.html`][metadata] is written in HTML.
Anything between the double curly braces is run and,
if there's output, that output is included in the HTML.
You might think of it as a [`glue`][glue] statement writ large.
The operators will be even more familiar to you
if you've ever used the [`whisker`][whisker] package.

### HTML Partials

`layouts/partials/page_metadata.html` is not a full web page;
it's a _partial_ page dictating only how to display a page's metadata.
That allows this same HTML template to be reused in several places:

* `layouts/partials/page_header.html`
* `layouts/partials/li_compact.html`
* `layouts/partials/li_list.html`
* `layouts/partials/li_card.html`

You can trace through what is used where if you have your site open in RStudio
by using the `Command+Shift+F` (or `Control+Shift+F`, for Window)
"Find in Files" functionality.

`page_header.html` for example is in turn used in a whole host of HTML pages,
including `layouts/section/post.html`.
And that is how we end up seeing our output
at the top of the page you're currently reading.
