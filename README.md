# My website

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my personal website,
[https://benjamin-wolfe.netlify.com][1].
I try to be as open & educational as possible in my work.
You'll find a log at [log.md][2] where I journal out my progress,
and of course you can look at the [commit log][3].

I'm a huge fan of the open-source world,
having only really found tools like git, GitHub, R, and Python in my 30s.
Please feel free to hit me up with questions about my work.
I'm happy to share knowledge and help you on your way.

Also feel free to make requests or suggestions,
either here as [issues][4]
or more informally on [Twitter][5].
